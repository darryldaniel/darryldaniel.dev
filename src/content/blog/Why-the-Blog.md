I always wanted to start a blog. It's been a long time dream of mine. I've actually had a few iterations where I searched for the perfect
technology to use, theme, hosting provider. Needless to say none of it gained any traction. There was always something I wanted to make
better, a new technology I wanted to try.

In truth, the major reason it's taken me so long to get something up is my motivation. I wanted to turn this into a side-hustle. The
writing had to be elegant and engaging. There had to be a long-term monetisation strategy. I'm not sure if this happens with age but I
find myself not caring too much about any of that any longer.

I think I'm at a point in my life where enough is enough. I have a fulfilling job with enough to challenge me. A workplace that is truly
a joy to be a part of. A family that I love to spend time with and that I wouldn't give up time with for anything or anyone. There isn't
too much more that I need from my life. I know this is rare so I reflect on this point in my life with all the gratitude in the world. I
feel truly content.

This then begs the question, why start this blog. It's for me. This is what I love. Building and designing something. Getting my thoughts
out, documenting my learnings. I hope someone finds this and reads it. I hope someone learns something from my writing. I doubt I'll have
any groundbreaking ideas but in my experience, something explained in just the right way is all you need. In any case, if none of that
happens, it'll still be worth it, and I'll still be grateful.
